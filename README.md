# Intermittent Session Check Failure in Next.js 15 with NextAuth.js

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in a Next.js 15 application using NextAuth.js for authentication.  The `/about` page intermittently fails to correctly check the user's session, granting access even when the user is not logged in.

## Bug Description

The `unstable_getServerSession` function, used to retrieve the user's session, sometimes returns `null` even when a session exists. This leads to incorrect access control on the protected `/about` page.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Navigate to `/about`.  Observe that access is sometimes granted even without logging in.  Refresh the page to see the intermittent nature of the issue. 

## Solution

The solution involves a more robust error handling mechanism and ensuring that the session check is properly handled within the asynchronous context. The `aboutSolution.js` file provides a corrected implementation.
